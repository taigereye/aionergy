# Aionergy

At Aionergy, we are on a mission to democratize clean energy access. We are building an AI-powered time-based marketplace that houses an immutable record of when clean energy is produced and consumed. With Aionergy, you will not need hourly tracking capabilities to begin matching your energy usage to the same hour when clean electricity was produced on the grid.

This repo contains some initial prototypes for V1 of the product, which is focused on standardizing the data model and pipelines for hourly energy tracking.
